# Tosin's Portfolio — Bootstrap Multi-page Template

Files included:
- index.html
- about.html
- projects.html
- skills.html
- contact.html
- css/style.css
- assets/profile.svg (placeholder image)
- assets/Tosin_Oriowo_CV.pdf (placeholder CV — replace with your real CV)

## How to use
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Replace `assets/profile.svg` with your real photo **(same file name)** or update paths in the HTML.
3. Replace `assets/Tosin_Oriowo_CV.pdf` with your CV PDF (keep the same filename or update links).
4. Edit any text in the `.html` files (they are plain HTML — easy to edit).
5. To publish on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `tosin-portfolio`).
   - Upload all files to the repository's root (or push via git).
   - In the repository settings → Pages, select the `main` (or `master`) branch and root folder, then save.
   - Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` or at `https://<your-username>.github.io` if you name the repo `<your-username>.github.io`.
6. To add a video on the homepage:
   - Replace the `<img>` in `index.html` card with an embedded `<video>` tag or an iframe (YouTube/Vimeo).
   - Example:
     `<video controls src="assets/your-video.mp4" style="width:100%; height:260px; object-fit:cover"></video>`

## Need changes?
If you'd like me to:
- personalize copy (more detail on projects),
- adjust the color scheme,
- add a contact form backed by a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms),
I can update the files for you — tell me what to change and I'll regenerate the package.
